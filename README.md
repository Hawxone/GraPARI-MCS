Maintenance Check System using PHP & Laravel 5.8 Framework

Before running the app migrate the database by using 
```
php artisan migrate
```

and then start the test server by using

```
php artisan serve
```

i'm using postgreSQL as database here so if you want to change the database please configure the .env file first before migrating
